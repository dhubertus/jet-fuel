* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
We are proud of the work we put into JetFuel. 
For JetFuel using the first backend we have ever built, we are proud of the ways we found to solve issues as they came along.
This project also forced us to dive into the relationship between front end and backend as well as understaand config files and environments.

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
Testing - We struggled to include full testing as we had issues with utilizing berfore each to roll back tables between tests.
We have a branch that has the 'proper' configuration including a test seed and test db utilizing our migration however we are still experienceing issues.
We also have some code sanitiation we wish we could have handled.
